## Overview

The Tagcat service provides a light-weight, scalable service to store metadata and tag information about objects inside your application.

It supports storing three types of information about objects or items in a system:

1. Metadata - Short key/value information to attach to an item
2. Tag - Tagging or labeling an item
3. Relationships - Links, references, or relationships between items
